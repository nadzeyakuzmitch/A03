Step 2: Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
Step 3: Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
Step 4: "Push" your changes to your main branch
Step 5: Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
Step 6: "Pull" the changes to your local machine
Step 7: Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
Step 8: Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
Step 9: "Merge" your branch to the main branch


Branch - displays when anyone visits your repository.
Clone - Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time.
Commit - an individual change to a file (or set of files).
Fetch - downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.
GIT - Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management.
Github - GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features.
Merge - Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. 
Merge Conflict - Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
Push - The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
Pull - The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
Remote - remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories.
Repository - A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
